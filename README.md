# Color based object identification and pick and place using BeagleBone Blue board

A low-cost, edge-based robotic arm system using a USB camera and BeagleBone Blue. This project identifies objects based on color using computer vision and controls a 4-axis robotic arm through I2C-enabled servo driver or direct PWM outputs for pick-and-place tasks.

## Project Highlights

* Real-time **color detection** using OpenCV
* Object shape analysis with contour filtering
* 4-axis **servo-driven robotic arm** control
* I2C-based servo driver (PCA9685) or direct PWM
* Fully integrated with **BeagleBone Blue**
* USB camera + live image processing
* Wireless SSH/VNC + SD card expansion
